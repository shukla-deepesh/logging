# MIP Python training
This is a collaborative initiative. There will be people driving it forward (AK, Cataldo, Mani etc.) by providing guidance, however its success is best achieved when everyone is involved into it. Please feel free to contribute with the exercise creations. If you see a topic that you fell is important and that is missing, please let us know.
 
Let's make this great all together! 

 
## Folder structure
* source code in `<src>`, data in `<data>` folders, tests in the `<test>` folder
* within `<src>` we will have a separate package (folder) for each problem we will tackle. E.g. The first week problem is in `<logexception>`


## Usage
In order to start playing with the code, pull the code and create a branch with your name.

For any question, contact [Cataldo Azzariti](cataldo.azzariti@sapient.com), [Mani](manimegalai.jaganathan@sapient.com) and [AK](anubhav.khanna@sapient.com).
